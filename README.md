## This Repo Is Totally `beginner friendly`, Perfect For Your `First Pull Request`:
📢 **Hacktoberfest is an annual worldwide event held during the month of October. The event encourages open source developers to contribute to repositories through pull requests (PR).**

🚀**[Register](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com) anytime between September 26 and October 31**

🎮**You can join Hactoberfest [`Discord Server`](https://e.customeriomail.com/e/c/eyJlbWFpbF9pZCI6ImRnVHdvZ1VBQU16ZktjdmZLUUdLNGZObDc4c1B0Uk1DdHdWcTQ4QT0iLCJocmVmIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9kaXNjb3JkLmNvbS9pbnZpdGUvaGFja3RvYmVyZmVzdCIsImludGVybmFsIjoiZjBhMjA1MTZhYmJiMDFjY2RmMjkiLCJsaW5rX2lkIjoxMzJ9/c7dfa7efbdc718aa395bd71a49a7b23f15d2e1f767cb53b5880eb70d77e525c7)**

🎉**Participants with four pull/merge requests accepted between October 1 and October 31 will receive a `unique digital reward🔥`**

## Note:

**Always make more than 4 pull requests.
Let's say you have made only 4 pull requests to different projects,
but one project is excluded from hackoctoberfest event then your pull request will not be counted and 
then you have the remaining 3 valid pull requests if these projects are not excluded.
If you fail to make 4 pull requests then you can't get your digital reward.
I will recommend you make a pull request to your own repo which is very very safe for you.
Keep in mind that the repo has hacktoberfest topic.**
